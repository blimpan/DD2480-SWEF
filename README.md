## The Mission of the Project

The Launch Interceptor Project implements a function called `DECIDE()` that determines whether an interceptor should be launched based on input radar tracking information. It evaluates a set of conditions known as Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs) against radar data points to generate a boolean signal that indicates whether to issue a launch-unlock signal.

## Why This Project is a Game Changer

This project is crucial for anti-ballistic missile systems, providing a systematic approach to decision-making based on real-time radar data. By evaluating multiple conditions for interceptor launch, it enhances the reliability and safety of missile defense operations, ensuring that launches occur only when necessary conditions are met.

## Your Launch Pad: Getting Started

To create your own Launch Interceptor, you will need to prepare the following attributes:

1. **NUMPOINTS**: The number of planar data points (ranging from 2 to 100).
2. **POINTS**: An array containing the coordinates of the data points, formatted as pairs of X and Y coordinates.
3. **PARAMETERS**: A struct holding various parameters for the LICs, including:
    - `LENGTH1`: Length threshold for distance evaluations.
    - `RADIUS1`: Radius for circular containment checks.
    - `EPSILON`: Epsilon threshold for angle evaluations.
    - `AREA1`: Area threshold for triangle evaluations.
    - `Q_PTS`: Number of points to consider in quadrant evaluations.
    - `QUADS`: Number of quadrants threshold.
    - Additional parameters for other LICs.
4. **LCM**: A Logical Connector Matrix defining how individual LICs should be combined (AND, OR, or NOTUSED).
5. **PUV**: A Preliminary Unlocking Vector indicating which LICs are relevant for the launch decision.
