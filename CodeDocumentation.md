# Launch Interceptor Program

## Introduction

The Launch Interceptor Program is designed to evaluate radar tracking information as part of an anti-ballistic missile system. The core function, `DECIDE()`, generates a boolean signal indicating whether an interceptor should be launched based on various Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs). The program processes up to 100 planar data points to assess the conditions for a potential launch. The system utilizes a Conditions Met Vector (CMV) and a Logical Connector Matrix (LCM) to determine the final launch decision through a Preliminary Unlocking Matrix (PUM) and a Final Unlocking Vector (FUV).

## Code Infrastructure

The project consists of two primary Java files:

1. **LaunchInterceptor.java**: This file contains the implementation of the `LaunchInterceptor` class.
2. **LaunchInterceptorTest.java**: This file includes unit tests for the methods defined in the `LaunchInterceptor` class.

## LaunchInterceptor.java

This file implements the `LaunchInterceptor` class, which encapsulates the logic for evaluating the various LICs based on the input radar data.
